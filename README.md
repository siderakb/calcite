Kailh Choc V1 (aka PG1350) low profile switches ortho keyboard, includes PCB and CNC/3DP case, inspired by [ARTSEY](https://artsey.io/), [Home row mods](https://precondition.github.io/home-row-mods) and Preonic/Planck keyboard.

## Note

Gerber, BOM and CPL files are generated by [KiCad JLCPCB Tools](https://github.com/Bouni/kicad-jlcpcb-tools) plugin.  

I use [KiCAD KLE Placer](https://github.com/zykrah/kicad-kle-placer) plugin to automatically place switch footprints.

If `key-switches.pretty` folder is empty, use `git submodule update --init` to clone submodule.
