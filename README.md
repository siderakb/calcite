## Note

Gerber, BOM and CPL files are generated by [KiCad JLCPCB Tools](https://github.com/Bouni/kicad-jlcpcb-tools) plugin.  

I use [KiCAD KLE Placer](https://github.com/zykrah/kicad-kle-placer) plugin to automatically place switch footprints.

If `key-switches.pretty` folder is empty, execute `git submodule update --init` to clone submodule.
